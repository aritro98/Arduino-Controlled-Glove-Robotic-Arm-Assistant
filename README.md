# Arduino Controlled Glove Robotic Arm Assistant

A six-axis robotic arm controlled by hand gestures using an Arduino-based sensor glove and ESP‑NOW wireless protocol. Designed to empower individuals with limited mobility by enabling one‑arm operation to manipulate objects with precision.

## About the Project
This project integrates a flex‑sensor glove with an Arduino microcontroller to command a 5‑degree‑of‑freedom robotic arm. The glove captures finger movements and translates them to servo positions, enabling intuitive human‑machine interaction.
**Key goals**:
- Real‑time motion mapping
- Modular firmware for easy extension
- 3D‑printed and CAD‑designed structural parts
